# Hey, I'm Ahmed ElShennawy 👋

## Full-Stack Oriented Front-End Developer

I'm a self-driven front-end developer who treats every UI like it's a final boss fight — nothing sloppy survives. I blend creative intuition with technical discipline to turn ideas into smooth, performant user experiences.

### 🎯 What I Do

I build responsive web applications with a strong eye for detail and a love for clean, pixel-perfect interfaces. From e-commerce platforms to management systems, I create user-friendly experiences that look great and work flawlessly across all devices.

### ⚡ My Approach

- **Fast & Focused**: I move quickly without cutting corners — delivering clean builds fast, then refining with precision
- **Pixel Precision**: Every component I craft is intentional — I obsess over alignment, spacing, and visual clarity
- **Mobile-First Always**: From the smallest screens up, I design interfaces that feel smooth, natural, and touch-friendly
- **Clarity Wins**: Whether in code or communication, I keep things clear — no guesswork, no messy logic
